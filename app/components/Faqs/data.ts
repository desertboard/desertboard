      answer: `<p>Yes, DesertBoard produces fire-rated door cores under its PSB® product line, certified to meet
      global and local fire safety standards. These door cores offer fire resistance for 90, 60, and 30 minutes, providing critical time for safe evacuation in
      emergencies. DesertBoard’s certifications include EN-1634-1 (European standard for fire resistance), BS-476 (British standard for fire tests on building
      materials and structures), and UL-10C (American standard for fire tests of door assemblies).
      In the UAE, local testing facilities such as Emirates Safety Laboratory prioritize EN-1634-1 and BS-476 standards, while in KSA, they prioritize the UL-10C
      (USA standard). DesertBoard is also actively working on obtaining certifications for regions like India to ensure compliance with their specific testing standards.
      This commitment to uncompromising safety ensures that DesertBoard’s fire-rated door cores meet the highest global requirements.</p>`
